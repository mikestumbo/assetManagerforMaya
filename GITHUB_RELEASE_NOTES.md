# ⚡ Performance Fixes - Non-Blocking Auto-Update

## 🎯 **Responsive UI During Updates**

**Problem Solved**: Auto-update system was freezing Maya interface during GitHub API calls and downloads.

**Solution**: Implemented background threading for all update operations while maintaining thread-safe UI updates.

### ✨ **Key Improvements**

- **🚀 Instant Response**: Update checks no longer freeze Maya UI
- **📥 Background Downloads**: Update installation runs asynchronously
- **📊 Progress Feedback**: Status bar shows current operation progress
- **🛡️ Error Resilience**: Network timeouts and errors handled gracefully
- **🔄 Same Functionality**: All existing features preserved with better performance

### 🔧 **Technical Changes**

- Converted `_on_check_update()` to use background threads for GitHub API calls
- Refactored `_download_and_install_update()` for non-blocking installation
- Added thread-safe UI callbacks using `QTimer.singleShot()`
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Backward compatible - no breaking changes

### 🎁 **User Benefits**

- ✅ Maya remains fully interactive during update checks
- ✅ No more UI freezing during downloads
- ✅ Clear progress feedback throughout the process
- ✅ Automatic backup and restoration on installation errors
- ✅ Seamless upgrade experience from v1.4.2
