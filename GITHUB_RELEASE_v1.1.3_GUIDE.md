## Automated Steps Completed
- [x] Created annotated git tag `v1.1.3` pointing to commit `de2f8d1`

## Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Push the Git Tag

**Option A: Command Line (requires authentication)**
The git tag `v1.1.3` has been created locally but needs to be pushed to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin v1.1.3
```

**Option B: GitHub Web Interface**
If command line authentication fails:
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/mikestumbo/assetManagerforMaya/tags
2. Click "Create a new tag" or use the existing local tag when creating the release
3. The release creation process can create the tag automatically if it doesn't exist

### Step 2: Create GitHub Release

#### Option A: Using Existing Tag (if successfully pushed)
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/mikestumbo/assetManagerforMaya/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Select existing tag `v1.1.3` from dropdown

#### Option B: Create Tag During Release (if tag push failed)
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/mikestumbo/assetManagerforMaya/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"  
3. Type `v1.1.3` in the "Choose a tag" field
4. Select target: `copilot/fix-da2f6a2a-0c14-4c33-bbbb-159d95b921ec`
5. GitHub will create the tag automatically when you publish the release
