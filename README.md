```text
Installation Architecture:
├── setup.py                 # Core AssetManagerInstaller class
├── DRAG&DROP.mel           # Maya GUI → calls setup.py core
├── install.bat             # Windows CLI → calls setup.py core  
├── install.sh              # Unix CLI → calls setup.py core
└── All methods produce identical Maya installations
```

**AssetManagerInstaller Class Methods**:

- `copy_asset_file()` - Copies main assetManager.py with error handling
- `copy_source_directory()` - Recursively copies src/ folder with validation
- `copy_icon_files()` - Copies custom icons with fallback handling
- `install()` - Main installation orchestrator following Clean Code principles

### **⚡ Upgrading from Previous Versions**

**Important for v1.3.0**: Clear Maya cache to ensure all EMSA components work properly:

1. **Clear Cache**: Run `CLEAR_MAYA_CACHE.mel` in Maya's Script Editor first
2. **Restart Maya**: Completely close and reopen Maya
3. **Install**: Use any of the unified installation methods above
4. **Verify**: Module loads with `import assetManager; assetManager.show_asset_manager()`

### **🛠️ Troubleshooting**

**Installation Issues**:

- Ensure Python 3.x is installed and accessible from command line
- Check Maya scripts directory permissions (may need administrator/sudo)
- Verify Maya 2025.3+ compatibility
- Clear Maya cache before upgrading to v1.3.0

**Module Loading Issues**:

- Restart Maya completely after installation
- Verify files copied to correct Maya scripts directory
- Check for Python import errors in Maya Script Editor
- Use hot reload system during development (see `dev_hot_reload.py`)

**Professional Support**: See `docs/MAYA_INSTALLATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for comprehensive troubleshooting.

### **🎯 Which Method Should I Use?**

| User Type | Recommended Method | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| **Maya Artists** | `DRAG&DROP.mel` | Easiest, creates shelf button, Maya-native experience |
| **Windows Users** | `install.bat` | Professional Windows installer with validation |
| **Unix/Linux/macOS** | `install.sh` | Cross-platform terminal installer with colors |

## ⚙️ Configuration

The plugin automatically creates configuration in:

- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/maya/assetManager/config.json`
- **Unix/Linux**: `~/Documents/maya/assetManager/config.json`

Configuration includes:

- Current project settings
- Asset library metadata
- Tags and collections data
- Dependency relationships
- Version information

## 🎯 New Workflows

### Organizing Assets by Type

1. Tag assets: "character", "prop", "environment", "texture"
2. Create collections: "Character Assets", "Environment Kit", "UI Elements"
3. Filter library by tag or collection as needed

### Managing Asset Dependencies

1. Create main scene asset
2. Track dependencies on component assets
3. Use dependency viewer to understand impact of changes
4. Update dependent assets when dependencies change

### Version Control Workflow

1. Create initial asset version
2. Make changes to asset
3. Create new version with descriptive notes
4. Compare versions using version history
5. Revert to previous version if needed

## 🔄 **Migration from Previous Versions**

### **Upgrading to v1.3.0 EMSA**

**⚠️ Important**: Clear Maya cache before upgrading to ensure all EMSA components work properly:

1. **Run** `CLEAR_MAYA_CACHE.mel` in Maya's Script Editor
2. **Restart Maya** completely
3. **Install** v1.3.0 using the drag & drop method
