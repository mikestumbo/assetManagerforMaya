# Session Summary - October 6, 2025

## Objectives Completed âœ…

We successfully resolved all four blocking issues for the v1.3.0 release:

### 1. âœ… Remove from Library (FIXED)

- **Issue**: Asset removal not working properly
- **Fix**: Replaced direct repository calls with LibraryService coordination
- **Location**: `src/ui/asset_manager_window.py` â†’ `_on_remove_selected_asset()`
- **Key Improvement**: Proper file deletion + repository update with duck typing validation

### 2. âœ… Drag and Drop (FIXED)

- **Issue**: Drag to Maya viewport not functioning
- **Fix**: Created custom `DragEnabledAssetList` with proper mime data
- **Location**: `src/ui/widgets/asset_library_widget.py` â†’ New class
- **Key Improvement**: File URLs in mime data enable Maya import via drag

### 3. âœ… Screenshot Button in Toolbar (FIXED)

- **Issue**: Screenshot only available in preview window
- **Fix**: Added "ðŸ“¸ Screenshot" button to main toolbar
- **Location**: `src/ui/asset_manager_window.py` â†’ `_create_main_toolbar()`, `_on_capture_screenshot_for_selected()`
- **Key Improvement**: Always accessible, works from any view/tab

### 4. âœ… Screenshot in Context Menu (FIXED)

- **Issue**: No screenshot option when right-clicking assets
- **Fix**: Added "ðŸ“¸ Capture Screenshot" to context menu
- **Location**: `src/ui/widgets/asset_library_widget.py` â†’ `_show_context_menu()`, `_capture_screenshot()`
- **Key Improvement**: Quick access via right-click, immediate thumbnail refresh

   - Added `_on_capture_screenshot_for_selected()` handler
   - Added `_refresh_library_after_screenshot()` callback
   - Added screenshot button to toolbar in `_create_main_toolbar()`

2. **src/ui/widgets/asset_library_widget.py**
   - Created `DragEnabledAssetList` class for drag and drop
   - Updated `_create_asset_list()` to use new drag-enabled list
   - Added `_capture_screenshot()` handler for context menu
   - Added screenshot option to `_show_context_menu()`

3. **docs/FIXES_IMPLEMENTED_v1.3.0.md** (NEW)
   - Complete documentation of all fixes
   - Testing checklist
   - Architecture benefits
   - Release readiness status

---

## Technical Approach

All fixes follow these principles:

1. **Duck Typing**: Used `hasattr()` checks instead of `isinstance()` to avoid module path issues
2. **Service Architecture**: LibraryService coordinates file operations with repository updates
3. **Clean Code**: Single Responsibility Principle applied to all methods
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user feedback
5. **User Experience**: Multiple access points for common operations

## Testing Required

Before final release, test in actual Maya 2025+ environment:

### Remove from Library

- [ ] Toolbar button removes asset and deletes file
- [ ] Multiple assets can be removed at once
- [ ] UI refreshes correctly after removal
- [ ] Error messages for failures

### Drag and Drop

- [ ] Drag from Recent tab to Maya viewport
- [ ] Drag from Favorites tab to Maya viewport  
- [ ] Drag from Library tab to Maya viewport
- [ ] Maya imports the asset correctly

### Screenshot Capture

- [ ] Toolbar button opens dialog for selected asset
- [ ] Context menu option opens dialog
- [ ] Preview window button still works
- [ ] Thumbnails refresh after capture
- [ ] Works with assets that have no thumbnail yet

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test all fixes in Maya 2025+
2. **Post-Testing**: Any bug fixes needed
3. **UI Updates**: Display and design improvements (separate phase)
4. **Release**: Package and publish v1.3.0

---

## Status: READY FOR TESTING âœ…

All blocking issues have been resolved. The asset manager is now ready for comprehensive testing in the Maya environment before final release.
