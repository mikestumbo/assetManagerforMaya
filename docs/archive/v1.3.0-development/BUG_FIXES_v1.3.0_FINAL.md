# Bug Fixes v1.3.0 - Final Testing Release

## Overview

This document details the critical bug fixes applied to resolve the 4 reported issues in the Asset Manager v1.3.0 before the Friday deadline.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Redundant Screenshot Button in Toolbar

**Problem**: Screenshot button appeared in both the toolbar AND the Asset Library context menu, creating confusion.

**Root Cause**: Toolbar screenshot action was redundant since the context menu already provides this functionality with better context (knowing which asset to screenshot).

**Solution**: Removed the screenshot button and all related handlers from the main toolbar in `src/ui/asset_manager_window.py`:

- Removed `_screenshot_action` creation in `_create_main_toolbar()`
- Removed `_on_screenshot_requested()` handler method
- Removed signal connections for screenshot functionality

**Files Modified**:

- `src/ui/asset_manager_window.py`

### 2. âœ… Context Menu Using Emoji Instead of Custom Icon

**Problem**: Screenshot context menu item displayed "ðŸ“¸ Capture Screenshot" using an emoji instead of the custom `screen-shot_icon.png`.

**Root Cause**: Icon path resolution wasn't looking in the correct location for the custom screenshot icon.

**Solution**: Added `_get_screenshot_icon_path()` method to properly resolve the icon path and updated the context menu creation in `src/ui/widgets/asset_library_widget.py`:

- New method checks both `icons/` and `../../icons/` relative paths
- Falls back to emoji if icon not found
- Context menu now displays custom icon when available

**Files Modified**:

- `src/ui/widgets/asset_library_widget.py`

---

### 3. âœ… Thumbnails Not Syncing After Screenshot Capture

**Problem**: After capturing a screenshot, the thumbnail in the library view would not update to show the new custom screenshot. The thumbnail file was being created correctly in `.thumbnails/[asset]_screenshot.png`, but the UI never reflected the change.

**Root Cause**: The screenshot callback was calling `refresh_library()` which completely recreated all list items. This caused a race condition where the asynchronous thumbnail generation would try to update list items that had already been deleted and recreated, resulting in the updates being applied to orphaned objects.

**Solution**: Changed the screenshot callback to use targeted refresh instead of full refresh in `src/ui/widgets/asset_library_widget.py`:

- Changed callback from `lambda: self.refresh_library()` to `lambda: self.refresh_thumbnails_for_assets([asset.file_path])`
- Updated `refresh_thumbnails_for_assets()` to work across ALL tab views (Library, Recent, Favorites)
- Fixed list widget access using `self._tab_widget.widget(1)` for Recent and `self._tab_widget.widget(2)` for Favorites
- This ensures async thumbnail updates target the correct list items without recreating the entire UI

**Files Modified**:

- `src/ui/widgets/asset_library_widget.py`

---

### 4. âœ… No Metadata in Asset Information Panel

**Problem**: When selecting an asset, the Asset Information panel would display basic info (name, path) but the metadata section remained completely empty even though assets had metadata.

**Root Cause**: The `_update_asset_info_display()` method was checking for `self._metadata_label` attribute which doesn't exist. The actual attribute is `self._metadata_widget`.

**Solution**: Fixed attribute check and added debug logging in `src/ui/asset_manager_window.py`:

- Changed `if hasattr(self._info_panel, '_metadata_label')` to `if hasattr(self._info_panel, '_metadata_widget')`
- Changed `metadata_label = self._info_panel._metadata_label` to `metadata_widget = self._info_panel._metadata_widget`
- Added debug logging to track when metadata display is called and what data is being set
- Ensured `asset_selected` signal properly connects to `_update_asset_info_display()`

**Files Modified**:

- `src/ui/asset_manager_window.py`

## Technical Details

### Signal/Slot Architecture

The fixes leverage PySide6's signal/slot system:

- Asset selection triggers `asset_selected` signal
- Signal connects to `_update_asset_info_display()` to populate metadata
- Screenshot completion triggers targeted thumbnail refresh instead of full UI rebuild

### Asynchronous Thumbnail Generation

The thumbnail system works as follows:

1. Screenshot captured â†’ stored in `.thumbnails/[asset]_screenshot.png`
2. Thumbnail service's `_check_custom_screenshot()` detects the new file
3. `refresh_thumbnails_for_assets()` called with specific asset paths
4. For each affected list item, `_generate_thumbnail_async()` queued
5. Async callback updates the specific list items across all tabs (Library, Recent, Favorites)

### Duck Typing Approach

Following EMSA architecture principles:

- No `isinstance()` checks across module boundaries
- Using `hasattr()` and `getattr()` for safe attribute access
- Checking for widget capabilities (`hasattr(widget, 'count')`) instead of type checking

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying v1.3.0, verify:

1. **Toolbar**:
   - [ ] No screenshot button in main toolbar
   - [ ] Only refresh, settings, and help buttons visible

2. **Context Menu**:
   - [ ] Screenshot menu item shows custom icon (not emoji)
   - [ ] Icon appears as camera icon from `icons/screen-shot_icon.png`

3. **Thumbnail Sync**:
   - [ ] Right-click asset â†’ "Capture Screenshot"
   - [ ] Maya viewport screenshot captured
   - [ ] Thumbnail updates immediately in Library tab
   - [ ] Thumbnail updates in Recent tab (if asset is recent)
   - [ ] Thumbnail updates in Favorites tab (if asset is favorited)
   - [ ] No need to refresh or switch tabs

4. **Metadata Display**:
   - [ ] Select any asset in library
   - [ ] Asset Information panel shows name and path
   - [ ] Metadata section populated with tags, category, etc.
   - [ ] Selecting different assets updates metadata correctly
