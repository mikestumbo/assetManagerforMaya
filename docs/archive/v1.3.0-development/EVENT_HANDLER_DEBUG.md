# Event Handler Debugging Added - v1.3.0

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** Debugging Enhanced

## Problem

User reports NO console output when:

- Clicking on asset (selection)
- Double-clicking asset (import)
- Using Import button
- Right-click → Remove from Library
- Drag-and-drop

This indicates event handlers are NOT firing at all!

## Debugging Added

### 1. Selection Handler (`asset_library_widget.py::_on_selection_changed`)

```python
print(f"🎯 Selection changed event fired!")
print(f"🎯 Selected items count: {len(selected_items)}")
print(f"🎯 Item data type: {type(asset)}")
print(f"✅ Asset selected: {asset.display_name}")
```

### 2. Double-Click Handler (`asset_library_widget.py::_on_item_double_clicked`)

```python
print(f"🖱️ Double-click event fired!")
print(f"🖱️ Asset data type: {type(asset)}")
print(f"✅ Emitting double-click signal for: {asset.display_name}")
```

### 3. Import Handler (`asset_manager_window.py::_on_asset_import`)

```python
print(f"🎬 Import request received for: {asset.display_name}")
print(f"🎬 Asset type: {type(asset)}")
print(f"🎬 Asset path: {asset.file_path}")
```

### 4. List Widget Creation (`asset_library_widget.py::_create_asset_list`)

```python
print(f"🎨 Creating asset list widget with event connections...")
print(f"✅ Asset list signals connected: itemSelectionChanged, itemDoubleClicked")
```

## Expected Output When Testing

### On Asset Manager Launch

```text
🎨 Creating asset list widget with event connections...
✅ Asset list signals connected: itemSelectionChanged, itemDoubleClicked
(repeated for each tab: All Assets, Recent, Favorites)
```

### On Single-Click Selection

```text
🎯 Selection changed event fired!
🎯 Selected items count: 1
🎯 Item data type: <class 'Asset'>
✅ Asset selected: Veteran_Rig
```

### On Double-Click

```text
🖱️ Double-click event fired!
🖱️ Asset data type: <class 'Asset'>
✅ Emitting double-click signal for: Veteran_Rig
🎬 Import request received for: Veteran_Rig
🎬 Asset type: <class 'Asset'>
🎬 Asset path: D:\Maya\projects\MyProject\assets\scenes\Veteran_Rig.mb
```

### On Import Button Click

```text
(Should see same output as double-click)
```

## Possible Causes If Still No Output

1. **Signals Not Connected**: List widget creation not being called
2. **Different List Widget**: Using wrong tab's list widget
3. **Qt Event Loop Issue**: Events not propagating
4. **Widget Focus Issue**: List widget doesn't have proper focus
5. **Selection Mode Issue**: Extended selection mode blocking events

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart Maya** (clear Python cache)
2. **Run DRAG&DROP.mel** to reinstall
3. **Open Asset Manager**
4. **Watch for list widget creation messages**
5. **Try clicking on asset**
6. **Share ALL console output**

## Next Steps Based on Output

### If We See List Widget Creation Messages

- Signals ARE being connected
- Problem is with event propagation or widget state

### If We DON'T See List Widget Creation Messages

- List widgets not being created properly
- Need to check tab widget initialization

### If We See Selection But Not Double-Click

- Selection works, double-click event blocked
- Check if IconMode affects double-click

### If We See Nothing

- Fundamental Qt event system issue
- May need to check widget hierarchy or Maya integration
