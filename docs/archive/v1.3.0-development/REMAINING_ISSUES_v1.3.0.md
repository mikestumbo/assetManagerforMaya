# Remaining Issues for v1.3.0 Release

**Date**: October 2, 2025 Evening
**Status**: BLOCKING RELEASE

## User Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ WORKING (Responsive)

1. **Delete from Project** - File deletion works correctly
2. **Import Buttons in Asset Manager** - Import operations work
3. **Screenshot Button (Preview Window)** - Works when asset has preview thumbnail

### ‚ùå NOT WORKING (Non-Responsive)

1. **Remove from Library** - Asset not responding to remove command
2. **Drag and Drop to Maya Viewport** - Not functioning
3. **Automatic Screenshot Creation** - Not triggering after import
4. **Screenshot Button (Library Icon View)** - Not working when viewing file-type icons

## Technical Analysis

### Issue #1: Remove from Library (NR)

**Observation**: Asset can be selected, imported, but "Remove from Library" command fails

**Likely Cause**:

- The isinstance() fix worked for `_on_selection_changed()` and `_on_item_double_clicked()`
- But "Remove from Library" uses a different code path (right-click menu or button)
- Need to check: `_remove_selected_asset()` or similar method

**Test Output Evidence**:

```te
‚úÖ Asset selected: Veteran_Rig
üóëÔ∏è Removing asset from library: Veteran_Rig
‚úÖ Successfully removed asset: Veteran_Rig
```

Note: Console shows "removing" and "successfully removed" but user reports NR

**Action Required**: Debug the actual UI response - likely disconnect between backend success and UI update

### Issue #2: Drag and Drop (NR)

**Observation**: Drag and drop to Maya viewport not working

**Likely Cause**:

- Separate drag/drop event handlers not covered by isinstance() fix
- Check: `dragEnterEvent()`, `dragMoveEvent()`, `dropEvent()` methods
- May need duck typing fix in drag handlers

**Action Required**: Apply isinstance() ‚Üí duck typing fix to drag/drop handlers

### Issue #3: Automatic Screenshot Creation (NR)

**Observation**: After import, automatic screenshot should be generated but isn't

**Context from Test Output**:

```te
üé¨ Asset imported to Maya - extracting full metadata and generating thumbnails
‚úÖ Full metadata extracted for Veteran_Rig.mb
üé¨ Generating PLAYBLAST thumbnails for imported asset: Veteran_Rig.mb
üñºÔ∏è Generated large playblast thumbnail for: Veteran_Rig.mb
```

**Analysis**: Playblast thumbnails ARE being generated, but user expected automatic screenshot?

**Clarification Needed**:

- Is "automatic screenshot" different from playblast thumbnails?
- Should screenshot button be automatically triggered after import?
- Or is the issue that playblast thumbnails aren't displaying as expected?

### Issue #4: Screenshot Button (Library Icon View - NR)

**Observation**: Screenshot button works in preview window, but not when viewing library icons

**Likely Cause**:

- Screenshot button may check asset state before capture
- When viewing file-type icon (no playblast yet), button may be checking for thumbnail existence
- May have condition like: `if asset.thumbnail_path: enable_button()`

**Action Required**:

- Remove conditional logic from screenshot button
- Button should ALWAYS work regardless of current thumbnail state
- Capture should work from Maya viewport, not require existing thumbnail

## Debugging Strategy for Tomorrow

### Phase 1: Remove from Library

1. Search for remove-related methods in `asset_library_widget.py`
2. Check for isinstance() usage in:
   - `_remove_selected_asset()`
   - `_on_remove_action()`
   - Right-click menu handlers
3. Apply duck typing fix as needed

### Phase 2: Drag and Drop

1. Search for drag/drop handlers in `asset_library_widget.py`
2. Look for isinstance() in:
   - `dragEnterEvent()`
   - `dragMoveEvent()`
   - `dropEvent()`
   - `mimeData()` creation
3. Apply duck typing fix

### Phase 3: Automatic Screenshot

1. Clarify user expectation (playblast vs manual screenshot)
2. Review import workflow in `asset_manager_window.py`
3. Check if screenshot should auto-trigger after import
4. Verify thumbnail display logic after import

### Phase 4: Screenshot Button State

1. Find screenshot button enable/disable logic
2. Remove conditional checks for existing thumbnails
3. Ensure button always enabled when asset selected
4. Test with both icon view and preview view

## Testing Checklist for Tomorrow

- [ ] Remove from library (right-click menu)
- [ ] Remove from library (button)
- [ ] Remove from library (keyboard shortcut if exists)
- [ ] Drag asset from library to Maya viewport
- [ ] Verify automatic screenshot/playblast after import
- [ ] Screenshot button with file-type icon (no thumbnail yet)
- [ ] Screenshot button with playblast thumbnail
- [ ] Screenshot button with custom screenshot
- [ ] All operations in Recent tab
- [ ] All operations in Favorites tab
- [ ] All operations in Library tab

## Code Files to Review Tomorrow

1. `src/ui/widgets/asset_library_widget.py` - Remove, drag/drop handlers
2. `src/ui/asset_manager_window.py` - Import workflow, screenshot logic
3. `src/ui/widgets/asset_preview_widget.py` - Screenshot button state

## Release Status

**STATUS**: ‚ùå BLOCKING ISSUES - NOT READY FOR RELEASE

**Timeline**: Fix tomorrow (Oct 3, 2025)
**Deadline**: Oct 3, 2025 evening
