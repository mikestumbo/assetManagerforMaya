# Maya Character Reference - QUICK GUIDE

## NEVER USE IN MAYA SCRIPTS:
❌ 🎯 🚀 ✅ ❌ ⚠️ ℹ️ 📦 🔧 🎨 📂 📄 🔄 💻 🛤️ 🧹 🎉

## ALWAYS USE INSTEAD:
[OK]       - Success/completion
[ERROR]    - Errors/failures  
[WARN]     - Warnings
[INFO]     - Information
[DONE]     - Task completion
[READY]    - System ready
[TEST]     - Testing/debug
[INSTALL]  - Installation steps
[FEATURES] - Feature highlights
[SYSTEM]   - System checks

## MAYA-SAFE FORMATTING:
=== Main Headers ===
--- Sub Sections ---  
*** Important Notes ***
... Progress Dots ...

* Bullet points
1. Numbered lists
- Dashes for sub-items

## PYTHON IN MEL - CRITICAL RULE:
❌ NEVER split Python lists across multiple python() calls
❌ NEVER split Python indented blocks (for, if, try) across calls
✅ Keep complete Python statements in single python() call
✅ Use \n for line breaks in multi-line Python code

WRONG:  python("for x in items:"); python("    print(x)");
RIGHT:  python("for x in items:\n    print(x)");

REMEMBER: Maya uses cp1252 codec - ASCII ONLY!
