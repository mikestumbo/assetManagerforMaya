By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

## Changelog Guidelines

We follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for version management.

### Adding Changelog Entries

**For every contribution, you MUST update the `CHANGELOG.md` file:**

1. **Location**: Add entries to the `[Unreleased]` section at the top of the changelog
2. **Categories**: Use the appropriate category for your change:
   - `Added` for new features
   - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality
   - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features
   - `Removed` for now removed features
   - `Fixed` for any bug fixes
   - `Security` in case of vulnerabilities

3. **Format**: Use clear, concise descriptions that explain the change from a user's perspective

#### Example Changelog Entry

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Changed in Unreleased

- Improved UI responsiveness for large asset libraries
- Updated Python dependency requirements

### Fixed in Unreleased

```

### Release Process

When preparing a release, maintainers will:

1. **Move entries** from `[Unreleased]` to a new version section
2. **Add version number** following semantic versioning (e.g., `[1.1.0]`)
3. **Add release date** in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
4. **Reset `[Unreleased]`** section with empty categories
5. **Update version links** at the bottom of the changelog

#### Version Numbering Guidelines

- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes or major new features
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New features that are backward compatible
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes and small improvements
