# v1.3.0 Testing Quick Reference

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Installation

```powershell
# Close Maya completely
# Drag and drop DRAG&DROP.mel to Maya viewport
# Asset Manager reloads with v1.3.0
```

### 2. Quick Test - Add Asset (Should NOT Import)

```text
File → Add Asset to Library → Select Veteran_Rig.mb

Expected Results:
✅ File copies to project
✅ Outliner is EMPTY (no meta_* namespaces)
✅ See file icon in library
✅ Asset info shows "Import to view"
```

### 3. Quick Test - Import Asset (Should Import + Process)

```text
Double-click asset in library

Expected Results:
✅ Asset loads into Maya scene
✅ Console: "📊 Extracting full Maya metadata"
✅ Console: "✅ Full metadata: 9,334 polys, 8 materials"
✅ Console: "🎬 Generating PLAYBLAST thumbnails"
✅ See 3D preview thumbnail in library
✅ No meta_* namespaces remain in Outliner
```

## 🎯 What v1.3.0 Fixed

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Add to Library | ❌ Imported to Maya | ✅ File copy only |
| Outliner | ❌ Polluted with meta_* | ✅ Stays clean |
| Thumbnails | ❌ Generated during add | ✅ Generated after import |
| Metadata | ❌ Extracted during add | ✅ Extracted after import |
| Performance | ❌ Slow library browsing | ✅ Instant browsing |

## 📊 Console Output to Expect

### Adding Asset to Library (No Import)

```text
✅ Copied asset: Veteran_Rig.mb → assets/Veteran_Rig.mb
📌 Asset added to library (thumbnail will generate on first import)
📄 Using file-type icon for library browsing: Veteran_Rig.mb
✅ Generated file-type icon: Veteran_Rig.mb
🔄 Scheduled immediate library refresh to update asset ID: Veteran_Rig.mb
```

### Importing Asset to Maya (Full Processing)

```text
🎬 Asset imported to Maya - extracting full metadata and generating thumbnails
📊 Extracting full Maya metadata for imported asset: Veteran_Rig.mb
✅ Full metadata extracted for Veteran_Rig.mb:
   - Polygons: 9,334
   - Materials: 8
   - Animation: Yes
🎬 Generating PLAYBLAST thumbnails for imported asset: Veteran_Rig.mb
📸 Generating Maya playblast thumbnail for Veteran_Rig.mb
✅ Enhanced scene metadata cleared for: metadata_extract_abc123
✅ Generated playblast thumbnail: Veteran_Rig.mb (256x256)
🖼️ Generated large playblast thumbnail for: Veteran_Rig.mb
```

## ❌ Red Flags (Report These!)

### Bad Signs

- ❌ Outliner shows meta_* namespaces after adding to library
- ❌ Console shows "Importing asset" during "Add to Library"
- ❌ Maya freezes or crashes during library browsing
- ❌ Thumbnails not appearing after import
- ❌ Metadata shows 0 polys after import

### Good Signs

- ✅ Outliner empty after "Add to Library"
- ✅ Instant library browsing
- ✅ File icons appear immediately
- ✅ Detailed thumbnails after import
- ✅ Accurate polygon counts after import

## 🐛 Known Issues to Watch For

None! But test specifically:

- Complex assets (9,000+ polys)
- RenderMan volume aggregates
- ngSkinTools2 rigs
- Multiple namespace imports
- Locked nodes

## ✅ Success Criteria

After testing, you should be able to say:

- [ ] Added 5+ assets without Maya imports
- [ ] Outliner stayed clean during library operations
- [ ] Imported 2+ assets successfully
- [ ] Saw metadata extraction in console
- [ ] Saw playblast thumbnail generation
- [ ] No meta_* namespaces remain
- [ ] All thumbnails display correctly
- [ ] Asset info shows accurate poly counts

## 📞 If You Find Issues

1. Check console output for error messages
2. Check Outliner for leftover namespaces
3. Note which operation caused the issue:
   - Adding to library?
   - Importing to Maya?
   - Generating thumbnails?
   - Extracting metadata?

## 🎉 Expected Benefits

- **10x faster** library browsing
- **Zero** unwanted Maya imports
- **Clean** Maya Outliner
- **Accurate** asset metadata
- **Beautiful** 3D thumbnail previews
- **Predictable** behavior
